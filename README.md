# Zombie DDoS

C++ Botnet based on a PHP C2

You should only change the line referring to the C2 URL inside the main C++ source, the rest of project are ready-to-use

### The botnet itself isn't ready to use in public internet, only use it for testing purposes!

Made for educational/testing purposes, i'm not aware of damages could make this thing.
